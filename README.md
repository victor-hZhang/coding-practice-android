Built on Android Studio version 3.0.1

Should be able to clone project and gradle build - build - run project with phone and emulator.

Using MVP as preferred pattern, 
We use a slightly modified MVP with interactor here, waived interactor to make code a bit simpler.

Screen support swipe down to refresh.
Havn't particullarly handle orentation, it works could have been better.
